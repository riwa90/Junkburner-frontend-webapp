# JunkBurner

School project in course DH2642 as part of KTH's BSc programme in Computer Engineering. Frontend application written in vue.js and hosted on googles firebase platform. Written together with fellow student Edvin Niemi.

The app lets you create a login and then lets you compose a meal of different junk food fetched from an external api. It displays the calories of the meal, and then suggests a workout to burn of the calories.

The apps architecture follows a MVVM pattern with containers as VM's for presentation components. The model has state management through the vuex library.
